#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Sharded MVCC disjoint-writer commit scaling probe (bd-bhh0i localization).
//!
//! The parallel-metadata-write gap (8.3x vs kernel @8t) is the per-op commit
//! coordination in `ShardedMvccStore`. The existing `sharded_mvcc_disjoint`
//! bench only sweeps 8/16/32 writers — no low-count baseline to see WHERE
//! scaling breaks. This sweeps 1..=32 disjoint writers (each committing
//! one-block txns into its own block range, mirroring the bench) and reports
//! commits/sec plus per-writer efficiency vs the 1-writer serial baseline.
//! A flat per-writer throughput = perfect scaling (commit is parallel); a
//! collapsing per-writer throughput pinpoints the serialization ceiling (the
//! global publication `wait_lock` / `active_snapshots` lock vs the per-shard
//! RwLock). Relative (per-writer efficiency) so it is robust to box load.
//!
//! Run: cargo run --release --example commit_scale -- [ops_per_writer]
