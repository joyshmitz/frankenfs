//! Automatic corruption recovery pipeline.
//!
//! [`ScrubWithRecovery`] connects the scrub engine ([`Scrubber`]) with the
//! recovery orchestrator ([`GroupRecoveryOrchestrator`]) and the evidence
//! ledger ([`EvidenceLedger`]).  When a scrub pass detects corruption, the
//! pipeline automatically attempts RaptorQ recovery, logs structured evidence
//! for every decision, and optionally refreshes repair symbols after a
//! successful recovery.
//!
//! # Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! scrub range → corrupt blocks → group recovery → evidence → symbol refresh
//! ```
