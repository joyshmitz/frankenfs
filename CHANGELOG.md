# Changelog

All notable changes to FrankenFS are documented in this file, organized by capability area rather than chronological diff order. Development has been continuous since inception; **`v0.2.0` (2026-07-11) is the project's first tagged release**, cut to mark the completion of the solo performance-optimization campaign. Commit links point to the canonical GitHub repository.

> **Repository:** <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs>
> **Period covered:** 2026-02-09 through 2026-07-11
> **Total commits:** 3,448 (through the 2026-05-18 capability cutoff; the performance campaign below adds the 2026-05-18 → 2026-07-11 window)
> **Tracker:** [`.beads/issues.jsonl`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl) (raw rows as of 2026-05-18: 2,859 closed, 45 open, 1 deferred; source-aware queue excludes 28 foreign-looking open rows)

> **What's new since the 2026-04-07 cutoff (2,765 additional commits):** the
> tracked V1 parity matrix is complete at 97/97, and most engineering attention
> has shifted from filling gaps to *gating public claims with structured
> evidence*. The dominant new themes are: a checked-in release-gate policy with
> proof-bundle lanes, the advisory readiness lab and permissioned campaign
> broker, hostile-image / adversarial threat-model containment, broad
> metamorphic-relation proptest coverage, an end-to-end schema inventory
> pinning every machine-readable report shape, an asupersync 0.2 → 0.3
> migration, and adaptive mount-runtime modes (`standard` / `managed` /
> `per-core`) with their own evidence manifests. The mounted write workload
> matrix, repair-writeback serializer, swarm responsiveness lanes, and soak /
> canary campaign reporter all landed in the same window.

## v0.2.0 — Performance Campaign (2026-05-18 → 2026-07-11)

A multi-agent, negative-evidence-ledger-first optimization campaign. Every kept
lever is **measured** (honest same-worker A/B interleaved in one binary, gated on
**median** self-time vs a **paired null control** — the identical arm run twice —
with cv < 5%), **isomorphism-preserving** (behaviour proven byte-identical, and
btrfs images pass `btrfs-check` / ext4 images pass `e2fsck` before the win is
kept), and **profile-first** (the mechanism comes from a callgrind/perf profile
or the code, never a guess). One lever per commit. Rejected levers are not
deleted — they are recorded with their null-control result and a *retry
condition* in the negative-evidence ledger, so no one re-attempts a dead end.

The comparator throughout is the mounted **kernel** filesystem (ext4 / btrfs).
Ratios below are the measured medians from the campaign; where a candidate
*failed* honest scrutiny (e.g. a headline cold-read row that flipped sign under
a corrected harness), that too is recorded rather than shipped.

### Checksum / CRC — the deepest vein

Incremental and zero-run-aware CRC primitives replaced whole-block recomputation
across every checksum site.

- **Incremental `crc32c` primitive** — roll a delta into an existing CRC instead
  of re-CRC-ing the whole block: **11.6×** vs full recompute
  [`ff222d17`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/ff222d17), widened to **14×** with a table-driven `raw_crc32c`
  [`2372577b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/2372577b) and **24.7×** with a branchless `gf2_matrix_times`
  [`17380f69`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/17380f69).
- **Incremental dir-block checksum** — **10.3×** vs full recompute
  [`56cb5f94`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/56cb5f94), wired into the CREATE/rename insert path (span-gated)
  at **9.25×** [`4976d6d7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/4976d6d7).
- **Zero-run-aware CRCs** — algebraically skip the zero tail: superblock **1.12×**
  [`041f04f4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/041f04f4) (completing the vein), plus zero-run-aware bitmap
  (2.54×), extent-node (3.52×) and dir-block (3.92×) variants.
- **Axis close** — the write-side inode checksum stamp was verified already
  no-copy (single-pass zero-in-place); crc32c uses the HW instruction and
  `csum_seed` is cached at open [`a5a97e12`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/a5a97e12).

### Metadata & directory operations — algorithmic complexity kills

The highest-value wins: several directory operations were quadratic and are now
linear or logarithmic.

- **Name-index closes the create existence-check `O(N²)`** — create went from
  **26× slower than kernel to kernel parity**
  [`1fcd0b62`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/1fcd0b62); hook extended to mkdir/mknod/symlink/link,
  `O(N²)→O(N)`, **75× → 1.35×** vs kernel [`96aa5c53`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/96aa5c53).
- **Delete htree fast-path** — removal `O(N²)→O(log N)`, delete gap **5.3× → 2.1×**
  [`85d46923`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/85d46923).
- **Coalesce contiguous extents on the file write-allocation path** —
  `O(N²)→O(N)`, **120× at N=40k** on fine-grained 4 KiB allocation
  [`2aa92946`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/2aa92946).
- **Rename preflights only the hash-target leaf**, not all dir blocks —
  `O(N²)→O(N)`, **5.57× at N=40k** [`51294142`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/51294142).
- **Shard the name-index** to fix a parallel-create rayon convoy — 4× *negative*
  scaling → 2×, kernel gap **16× → 8.3×** [`4cfc2dac`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/4cfc2dac).
- **htree leaf-search borrow** — lookup **2.5×**, helps every metadata op
  [`d52eb62e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/d52eb62e); skeletal `AttrOnly` inode parse for getattr **1.11×**
  [`8314ca8c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/8314ca8c); `MetadataOnly` parse for the name-index stamp **1.24×**
  [`bc47b311`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/bc47b311); `sort_unstable` for htree hash sorts **1.47×**
  [`a4ba9241`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/a4ba9241).

### SWAR / word-at-a-time primitives

Branchless byte-processing on hot string and hash paths.

- **Word-at-a-time hash for `extent_root_namespace`** — **7.14×**
  [`96c27663`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/96c27663).
- **SWAR one-pass path-component validation** (has-byte trick) — **3.41×**
  [`2a380996`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/2a380996); the has-zero family (name/path validate, first-NUL symlink) lands
  **3.1–4.0×**.
- **SWAR ASCII case-fold compare** for casefold directories — **1.64×**
  [`3dcf558f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/3dcf558f); SWAR word-at-a-time name compare **1.80×**.
- **`str2hashbuf` on a stack `[u32;8]`** — ~34% faster htree hash, removes a
  per-hash heap alloc [`a6c4c505`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/a6c4c505).

### Extent resolution & read path

- **Binary-search the ext4 extent leaf + index** — `O(E)→O(log E)`, **up to 19×**
  [`2785e425`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/2785e425).
- **Sequential mapping hint** on the per-block read resolve — **2.0–2.5×**, no
  downside [`751251da`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/751251da), extended to the readdir plan loops
  [`8334e658`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/8334e658).
- **Fix `ExtentCache` shard distribution** (hash the namespace) — **4.6×**
  many-inode read-data [`0301f38a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/0301f38a); extent-cache depth-1 borrow-in-place skips
  the per-block `Vec` take/store [`23986087`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/23986087).
- **Memoize journal-inode indirect resolution** in journal replay — fixes a
  **2024×** re-read at every mount [`fe00c75e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/fe00c75e), plus a multi-entry indirect-block
  memo [`f7c9f328`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/f7c9f328).
- **btrfs read directly into the caller buffer** in `read_into` — **1.37× warm,
  RSS halved, beats kernel** [`54b0ae94`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/54b0ae94); RO decompressed-extent cache
  **1.55×** compressed random read [`90bf7cfa`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/90bf7cfa).

### Allocator

- **Binary range-overlap for the free-path reserved check** — **up to 3110×**
  [`af91cc18`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/af91cc18).
- **Cache the per-group reserved-block set** — mkdir **2.77×**, all
  block-allocation ops [`37cdf5f8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/37cdf5f8); skip the per-alloc reserved-marking loop once
  the group is confirmed — mkdir **1.16×** [`c5df77f0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/c5df77f0).
- **Byte-wise inode-bitmap padding fill** — create **1.14×** / parallel **1.18×**
  [`369f1493`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/369f1493); skip the per-alloc largest-free-run rescan on the single-block path
  (~1.15×, exact-on-demand) [`8319465d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/8319465d).
- **Skip re-reading the unchanged bitmap** for the descriptor checksum —
  **15.8× fewer delete preads** [`b296dbdb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/b296dbdb).

### Compression — codec-context reuse

Swapped the DEFLATE backend to the pure-safe-Rust `zlib-rs` (byte-identical
output, no C toolchain, compatible with `unsafe_code = "forbid"`) and reuse the
codec context across calls.

- **Thread-local zlib inflate context reuse** in `btrfs_decompress` — **1.43×**
  decode, avoids the 32 KiB inflate-window alloc per call
  [`32a86235`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/32a86235); shared with e2compr gzip inflate — **2.21× at 4 KiB**
  [`85f0ccea`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/85f0ccea); level-keyed deflate (write) context reuse — **1.44×**
  [`a1e666c0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/a1e666c0).

### MVCC concurrency

- **Skip per-read snapshot register/release** for read-only reads — **5×**
  parallel random read [`9376f4d6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/9376f4d6).
- **Drop the forced 4096-realign** on version storage — **1.82× commit, 1.35×
  throughput** [`eb229915`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/eb229915).
- **Size the sharded store to host parallelism** instead of a fixed 8 shards —
  parallel writes **1.17× @16w / 1.29× @32w** [`a2807896`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/a2807896).

### btrfs COW batching

- **COW `insert_many` in-place batching** — **1.68×** on the btrfs-create insert
  pattern [`56fdc677`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/56fdc677); coalesce the create/mkdir/delete/rename parent updates via
  `insert_many`/`remove_many`: create **1.43×** (gap 3.0× → 2.08×)
  [`b5e22c17`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/b5e22c17), mkdir **1.45×** [`d518312a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/d518312a), delete **1.44×**
  [`aee47f35`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/aee47f35), rename **1.25×** [`f90648f5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/f90648f5).
- **`Arc<[u8]>` for COW item data** — **1.47×** create [`2e4e848d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/2e4e848d); **`FxHashMap`**
  node store — **1.20×** delete [`8b04930e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/8b04930e); separator-carry-forward removal makes
  rename separator recompute `O(max_items)→O(1)`, **+1.13× @40k**
  [`c911e8a5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/c911e8a5).
- **Fan-out gate the prefetch pool** — btrfs metadata walk **4.3×** (7× → 1.6× vs
  kernel) [`18fb0e88`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/18fb0e88); cold metadata is now **~3× faster than kernel** on a
  40k-file directory [`c27194d0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/c27194d0).

### CLI / global allocator

- **jemalloc global allocator** — create **1.26–1.6× faster** (now faster than
  kernel single-thread), parallel **2.2×** [`14f443cb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/14f443cb).
- **Parallelize `walk --read-data`** across files — many-small-files read **3.85×
  loss → 1.29× win** [`de194cb9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/de194cb9); cap the rayon pool for metadata-only walk —
  **1.57×** (4.0× vs kernel `find + stat`) [`e9800e82`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/e9800e82).

### Honesty ledger — what was measured and *not* shipped

The campaign is as much about rejected levers as kept ones. Representative
findings recorded (not shipped) in the negative-evidence ledger:

- **Cold-read headline correction** — the previously-reported "1.7× faster than
  kernel" cold row **flipped sign under a corrected harness**: frankenfs is
  actually **1.42× slower**, and ext4-indirect / fragmented cold rows are slower
  too [`913dd5c6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/913dd5c6), [`b873beac`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/b873beac). 41% of the best-config gap was traced to
  benchmark-harness overhead, not the filesystem [`ac08c8fd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/ac08c8fd).
- **`Arc<InodeAttr>` whole-workspace change** — ~10% *regression* on both
  filesystems (a 130 B POD memcpy is cheaper than two atomic RMWs + a miss
  alloc); retry only if `InodeAttr` grows large.
- **Interpolation search on extent resolution** — 3.46–6.6× faster on synthetic
  uniform data but **2.4–2.9× slower** on realistic skewed extents; ext4's
  ≤340-entry leaves are L1-resident, so comparisons beat the per-probe divide.
  Rejected [`ae941d38`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/ae941d38).
- **The GDT-defer 2.3× lever** was measured real (per-op group-descriptor writes
  are ~55% of ext4 create) but **shelved unshipped** pending a focused flush-pass
  fix rather than landed blind [`8451bb5e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/8451bb5e).

**Evidence sources for this section:** `docs/PERF_CAMPAIGN_FINAL.md` (the shipped
wins-by-axis and consolidated reject tables), `docs/PERF_CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md`
(live frontier statement), `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` and
`docs/progress/perf-negative-results.md` (per-lever null-control ledger), the
`perf(` / `bench(` commit history on `main`, and the `.beads/issues.jsonl`
tracker rows (bd-4tw2n, bd-vpypn, bd-ddryj, bd-bhh0i, bd-cowbatch, bd-xmh5g,
bd-f8rd8, and siblings).

## Readiness, Release Gates, and Proof Bundles

The single largest new workstream in this window. Tracked V1 parity reached
100% earlier in the year; the bridge to operationally-credible public claims
is now governed by a checked-in release-gate policy, a portable proof-bundle
artifact, and a structured advisory readiness lab.

- **Canonical release-gate policy v1** -- `tests/release-gates/release_gate_policy_v1.json` maps every public claim class (`mount.rw.ext4`, `mount.rw.btrfs`, `repair.rw.writeback`, `writeback_cache`, `swarm.responsiveness`, `security.hostile_image`, `performance.baseline`, `operational.soak_canary`, etc.) to required proof-bundle lanes, thresholds, kill switches, remediation beads, and explicit non-goals
  [`2104a1e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/2104a1ef615a112954e6280bc7214a4283ce5c0f),
  [`9132c6c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/9132c6c60093637d7db8838981ea2c366f7eec5e),
  [`068234d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/068234d9d8187d4771a24b133aba221f95a90f0b)

- **Operator proof bundle** rooted at `artifacts/proof/bundle/manifest.json` with 14 required lanes (`conformance`, `xfstests`, `fuse`, `differential_oracle`, `repair_lab`, `crash_replay`, `performance`, `writeback_cache`, `scrub_repair_status`, `known_deferrals`, `release_gates`, `swarm_workload_harness`, `swarm_tail_latency`, `adaptive_runtime`); validated via `ffs-harness validate-proof-bundle` with bundle id, git SHA, toolchain, kernel, mount capability, raw logs, gate inputs, artifact hashes, redaction policy, and reproduction command
  [`fa66e92`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/fa66e923af47e5acff032dc3050d889fed77609f)

- **Advisory readiness lab** -- non-permissioned operator rehearsal surface that regenerates contracts, host simulation, RCH dry-run schedules, truth-graph summaries, xfstests handoff packets, NUMA/p99 replay reports, and readiness-dashboard rows without exporting permissioned ACK variables. Every artifact carries `product_evidence_claim=none` and a release-gate effect equivalent to `advisory_only_no_public_readiness_change`
  [`77a3289`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/77a32890b05d0dfcf1b00e2be6ae5db0c1d242c6),

- **Permissioned campaign broker** -- packet/manifest/validator/ledger contract for xfstests and large-host swarm runs. Broker packets are operator handoff material and cannot be counted as `pass` evidence; ACK boundaries are exact strings (`XFSTESTS_REAL_RUN_ACK=xfstests-may-mutate-test-and-scratch-devices`, `FFS_SWARM_WORKLOAD_REAL_RUN_ACK=swarm-workload-may-use-permissioned-large-host`)
  [`b7d18b4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/b7d18b44e0e42d8a10d38468d92bbf4d3e59c757),

- **Swarm responsiveness lanes** -- three proof-bundle lanes (`swarm_workload_harness`, `swarm_tail_latency`, `adaptive_runtime`) connecting the NUMA-aware workload harness, p99 attribution ledger, and adaptive runtime opt-in evidence to the release-gate policy. Strict `host_class` rules block `small_host_smoke` / `capability_downgraded_smoke` lanes from upgrading public claims
  [`0f39df4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/0f39df4f5934e4b68af84ec9dcb7391d6af38425),

- **Soak / canary campaign reporter** -- `validate-soak-canary-campaigns` defines bounded smoke / nightly / stress / canary profiles, heartbeat logs, resource caps, flake follow-up rules, and proof-bundle / release-gate consumers
  [`fd5ab83`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/fd5ab831c4917ef3076ac9aa44d3872800c2ed6b),
  [`018fa31`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/018fa31fb5c353e2a55f4be5786ed606847b2aa4)

- **Source-aware tracker hygiene** -- `docs/tracker-hygiene.md` plus
  `./scripts/e2e/ffs_tracker_source_hygiene_e2e.sh` define a queue-state check
  that classifies `claimable_ids`, `permission_gated_ids`, and
  `excluded_foreign_open_count` so the swarm tracker survives multi-project
  pollution without illegally claiming foreign rows

## Hostile-Image and Adversarial Safety

A separate release-gated claim with its own threat model, fixtures, and
containment proofs.

- **Adversarial threat model** -- `security/adversarial_image_threat_model.json` defines how malformed images, hostile proof bundles, tampered repair ledgers, resource-exhaustion seeds, unsupported mount options, and unsafe operator-command combinations must be rejected, quarantined, capped, downgraded to detection-only, or preserved as evidence. Each containment scenario records resource class, limit value/unit, enforcement point, observed counters, cleanup policy, and confined artifact paths

## Metamorphic Relations and Schema Conformance

A systematic push to make every checksum, parser, and reporting surface
provably stable under input-shape perturbations and to lock every
machine-readable artifact's JSON shape to an inventory.

- **Metamorphic-relation proptests** across the parsing and checksum surface:
  - `crc32c_append` associativity (bd-oviw2)
  - `ext4_chksum` associativity (bd-8pbjm)
  - `dx_hash` zero-seed equivalence (bd-ldp92)
  - `ext4_casefold_key` idempotence (bd-8u2xy)
  - `ext4_gdt_crc16` associativity + empty-suffix MRs (bd-0djme)
  - `btrfs_send_crc32c` foundational laws (bd-gasht)
  - `btrfs_key_cmp` total-order laws (bd-f1k5j)
  - `Ext4GroupDesc::parse_from_bytes` determinism (bd-ewh2w)
  - `parse_from_image` determinism for both ext4 and btrfs (bd-vvkfy)
  - `verify_*_checksum` pair determinism (bd-begr3)
  - `batch_checksum` Blake3 variant (bd-2ihe1)
  - `btrfs_inode_ref` round-trip MRs into cargo test (bd-2nko1)
  - `touch_*` version-bump dispatch invariants (bd-wgvh5)
  - `bitmap` stamp/verify proptest MRs (bd-e5vp5)

- **Cross-oracle arbitration** -- when ext4/btrfs differential oracles disagree on observable filesystem behavior, an arbitration report classifies the disagreement (parser-class vs. host-class vs. permission-class) with a structural JSON contract
  [`4c0bd80`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/4c0bd80048dd837b0ed51b548e8308237b2b8ef2),

- **Schema inventory** -- every machine-readable report, manifest, and ledger
  in the project (writeback, swarm, repair, readiness, performance, fuzz
  dashboard, mounted lane, oracle recovery, hysteresis, reservation, agent
  mail) now has its JSON shape pinned in a checked-in inventory with
  structural validators and drift detectors

  [`a30882a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/a30882a61ebbe3a5e6b04c4086d3bdb8890804ad)

- **Round-trip + insta snapshots** on every emitted report -- 167+ snapshot
  commits pin the markdown/JSON output of release-gate, writeback-cache audit,
  ordering oracle, crash-replay oracle, repair confidence, repair corpus,
  fuzz-smoke, fuzz dashboard, mounted lane decision, soak/canary campaign,
  swarm operator/cache/tail latency, readiness lab truth graph, ambition
  evidence matrix, and parity audit reports

- **Fallible-by-default test refactor** -- bd-rchk0 turned dozens of
  best-effort `assert!`-only paths into fallible `Result`-returning tests so
  evidence-gate failures surface as structured errors rather than silent
  passes or harness panics

---

## Mount Runtime Modes and Adaptive Dispatcher

The optional adaptive mount runtime, default-off, that the `swarm.responsiveness`
and `adaptive_runtime` release lanes gate.

- **Runtime-mode CLI contract** -- `--runtime-mode {standard|managed|per-core}` exposes three execution profiles. `standard` is the existing FUSE dispatcher; `managed` adds explicit unmount timeout, evidence-bearing teardown, and adaptive backpressure-gate control; `per-core` enables per-thread routing with idle stealing
  [`db52ad5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/db52ad54b2c6bf151688daf0852bd431370fd183)

- **Adaptive runtime evidence manifest** (`docs/adaptive-runtime-evidence-manifest.json`) -- mount-runtime evidence contract validated by `ffs-harness validate-adaptive-runtime-manifest` and gated by the `adaptive_runtime` proof-bundle lane; default-off, requires `accepted_large_host` evidence with clean cleanup before any docs/release-gate upgrade

- **Per-core dispatcher hardening** -- idle stealing guarded against thread starvation, per-core metrics arithmetic saturated to prevent overflow under heavy load (bd-pcmet), and stale managed-mode placeholder removed

- **Managed backpressure gate** -- wired into `--runtime-mode managed` so that backpressure decisions can be observed and tuned without modifying the standard dispatcher's hot path (bd-jv6pj.2)
  [`db52ad5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/db52ad54b2c6bf151688daf0852bd431370fd183)

- **NUMA-aware tail-latency harness** -- `ffs_swarm_workload_harness_e2e.sh`, `ffs_swarm_tail_latency_e2e.sh`, and `ffs_adaptive_runtime_runner_e2e.sh` define safe local smoke flows. The `p99_attribution_ledger` artifact is mandatory inside the `swarm_tail_latency` proof-bundle lane

- **Topology runtime advisor manifest** (`docs/topology-runtime-advisor-manifest.json`) -- host topology hints consumed by the adaptive runtime in managed and per-core modes

---

## On-Disk Parsing (ext4)

Pure, I/O-free parsing of ext4 on-disk structures in `ffs-ondisk`. All parsers take `&[u8]` and return typed structures.

- **Initial ext4 superblock and structure parsing** -- superblock (106 fields), group descriptors (32-bit and 64-bit), inodes, extent header/entries, feature flag decoding

## Self-Healing Repair Pipeline

RaptorQ fountain-coded repair with Bayesian overhead optimization, scrub
pipeline, adaptive refresh, and multi-host coordination in `ffs-repair`. In
this window, mounted automatic repair shipped behind an explicit ledger flag,
the read-write mounted repair writeback serializer landed, and the evidence
ledger settled at 23 event types (`EvidenceEventType`).

- **Mounted automatic repair** -- `ffs mount --background-repair --background-scrub-ledger <jsonl>` enables real block recovery + repair-symbol refresh after writable backing-image access is verified. Read-only mounts use direct backing-image authority; read-write mounts route recovered source blocks through the mounted MVCC request-scope serializer so repair writes and client writes share the same conflict-resolution boundary
  [`b75f47a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/b75f47a3ef69c1e87bc974c9cc46c9cd02118417),

- **Repair writeback serialization contract** -- `docs/repair-writeback-serialization-contract.json` (57 KB) plus `docs/design-repair-writeback-serialization.md` formalize the state-machine, lease, MVCC epoch, fsync/fsyncdir, stale-symbol, cancellation, failure, route, stale-snapshot rejection, and writeback-cache-disabled proofs. Validated end-to-end by `./scripts/e2e/ffs_repair_writeback_route_e2e.sh`; the `repair.rw.writeback` release-gate claim depends on `repair_writeback_serialization_report.json` and `repair_writeback_route_artifact.json`
  [`e996265`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/e996265f1a2c4cf9648a45dca0a2f793d63e566d),

- **Repair confidence mutation safety** -- `docs/repair-confidence-mutation-safety.json` (31 KB) defines a matrix of safe / unsafe repair mutations and pairs each scenario with a confidence threshold, decoder-stat guard, and ledger contract. `bd-jv2vd` adds a repair confidence report snapshot
  [`c8ad3cf`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/c8ad3cf8be6d0fa16b5969911c1bcdc30fcf76d7)

## Writeback-Cache Epoch Barriers

Per-inode epoch state machine (`staged >= visible >= durable`) for FUSE
writeback-cache enablement, with crash consistency proofs in `ffs-core`. In
this window the kernel `writeback_cache` option moved from "design only" to
"explicit-opt-in, evidence-gated, default-off" with a complete operator
contract.

- **Writeback-cache epoch barrier** with per-inode epoch tracking (staged/visible/durable counters)
  [`541e178`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/541e178fb0785220b70e6949ff479b7f9908d7e8)

- **Writeback-cache opt-in operator contract** -- the only supported kernel `writeback_cache` path is `--rw --writeback-cache` plus three accepted artifacts (`--writeback-cache-gate`, `--writeback-cache-ordering-oracle`, `--writeback-cache-crash-replay-oracle`) plus a disarmed `FFS_WRITEBACK_CACHE_KILL_SWITCH` and a matching host/lane manifest. Validated by `ffs-harness validate-writeback-cache-audit`, `validate-writeback-cache-ordering`, and `validate-writeback-cache-crash-replay`, plus `./scripts/e2e/ffs_writeback_cache_audit_e2e.sh`. `flush()` remains explicitly non-durable; `fsync` / `fsyncdir` are the only durability boundaries
  [`d008eb6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/d008eb618149897859f93db2417f936a3648aa34),
  [`069ecba`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/069ecbab810ad6051ba266fd8e0463ba920b6396)

- **Writeback-cache crash/replay matrix oracle** -- 12-point crash matrix is now an artifact-level contract: all 12 crash point IDs, the mounted operation trace, raw FUSE options, survivor sets, flush/fsync/fsyncdir observations, cancellation and repeated-write classification, stdout/stderr paths, cleanup status, unsupported-combination rejections, and reproduction command are all required fields
  [`4cd6c03`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/4cd6c0374d5b03bcf6b7d4061fc94339833a0c4a)

- **Mounted-write reorder defense** -- `bd-tojwb` adds block-io writeback manifest rows so reorder regressions are caught at the manifest layer; `bd-17war` catalogues the writeback E2E scenario universe; `bd-slgzs` caps writeback drain polling so a stuck flush daemon cannot deadlock unmount

## CLI and Observability

The `ffs-cli` crate provides the command-line interface with 11 subcommands
(`inspect`, `mvcc-stats`, `info`, `dump`, `fsck`, `repair`, `mount`, `scrub`,
`parity`, `evidence`, `mkfs`). The `mount` subcommand has 22 flags
covering writeback-cache opt-in, background repair, adaptive runtime,
managed/per-core dispatcher, btrfs subvolume/snapshot selection, and ext4
external-journal pairing.

The writeback-cache kill switch is the `FFS_WRITEBACK_CACHE_KILL_SWITCH` environment variable (not a flag). The external-journal pairing, `ext4_journal_replay_mode`, and `ext4_data_err_policy` are library-API controls on `OpenOptions` (not CLI flags as of this window)

- **`ffs-cli inspect --subvolumes --snapshots`** -- enumerates btrfs subvolumes and snapshots from the CLI for operator-path scoping verification before mount

- **Readiness action CLI** -- new entrypoint to drive readiness-lab dry-runs, planning JSON, and validation JSON with insta-pinned outputs

## Fuzz Infrastructure

Fuzzing corpus, crash-to-regression promotion, and nightly fuzz dictionaries.

- **1281 fuzz corpus entries** for btrfs metadata, ext4 xattr, and VFS operations
  [`0ee5695`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/0ee5695ccea18561f40ff2e3220a47dbfcfe63a4)

  [`557f5fb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/557f5fbf78a4f8bcfe42d0be30bb7ccc1b122905)

- **60 fuzz targets** -- the corpus now spans every parser, allocator, codec, oracle, manifest, and dispatcher in the workspace. Notable new targets in this window: `fuzz_authoritative_lane_manifest`, `fuzz_path_component_validation`, `fuzz_xattr_parsing`, `fuzz_btrfs_tree_items`, `fuzz_cli_btrfs_parsers`, `fuzz_ext4_extra_bit_pack`, `fuzz_repair_symbols`, `fuzz_ext4_image_reader`, `fuzz_inode_roundtrip`, `fuzz_alloc_succinct`, `fuzz_ext4_checksums`, `fuzz_ext4_extent_actual_len`, `fuzz_swarm_workload_harness`, `fuzz_btrfs_devitem_roundtrip`, `fuzz_ext4_metadata`, `fuzz_ext4_chksum`, `fuzz_ext4_xattr`, `fuzz_fuzz_smoke_manifest`, `fuzz_ioctl_dispatch`, `fuzz_por_authenticator`, `fuzz_jbd2_replay`, `fuzz_ext4_fast_commit`, `fuzz_btrfs_tree_log`

- **Fuzz smoke + dashboard gates** -- `bd-rchk0.300` tracks the fuzz smoke report schema; `bd-rchk0.313` tracks fuzz dashboard JSON schemas; fuzz target registration guarded so a deleted/renamed target trips the gate (`bd-0c2xy`); fuzz smoke manifest fuzzer sources hardened against external manipulation

  [`8ddd3de`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/8ddd3defd26fa6367d75c07467024d3dd276cf41)

- **Performance manifest contracts** (`bd-rchk5.x` family) -- dated 2026-05-03 core and mounted throughput/latency artifacts, host/runtime metadata, delta closeout, no-reference decisions, and quarantined mounted-latency claims now flow through a single `validate-performance-manifest` contract. Quarantine and no-reference rows must be explicit; readiness wording cannot imply tuning is complete beyond the supported evidence tier

## Foundation Types and Error Handling

`ffs-types` (newtypes, checked arithmetic) and `ffs-error` (currently 21-variant `FfsError` enum with errno mappings; began life as a 14-variant taxonomy and grew with directory + repair + mode-violation surfaces).

- **Canonical error taxonomy** with 14-variant `FfsError` and POSIX errno mappings

  [`bd91c3d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/bd91c3d18e947e96730772f1fedaccb4505f59c7)

- **Design doctrine documentation** -- `docs/design-writeback-cache-mvcc.md` (18 KB) formalizes the 6 invariants and 12-scenario crash matrix; `docs/design-repair-writeback-serialization.md` defines mounted repair serializer rules; `docs/mount-runtime-modes.md` (13 KB) documents the standard/managed/per-core operator contract; `docs/oq1-native-mode-boundary.md` and `docs/oq7-version-store-format.md` resolve open questions about native-mode boundary semantics and BlockVersion persistence

- **Tracker hygiene doctrine** -- `docs/tracker-hygiene.md` (17 KB, refreshed 2026-05-16) defines source-aware queue-state semantics, the per-claim-state vocabulary, and the safe-claimability signal used when raw `br ready` / `bv` outputs are polluted by cross-project rows

- **xfstests known-failures registry** -- `docs/xfstests-known-failures.md` (18 KB) records the allowlist with rationale; gates ensure these never silently flip without ACK

- **Verification entrypoint normalization** -- the legacy `verify-goldens.sh` path now shims to canonical `verify_golden.sh`, keeping CI and operator workflows on one supported script
  [`162aa59`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/162aa59058469cc7384f63e861d76f589d999024)

- **Cargo.lock refresh** for newly committed harness/conformance dependency changes
  [`07bd37a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenfs/commit/07bd37a9423b7829e0fe42a8e7dbe91fc5664916)

- **Vendored fuser** -- `vendor/fuser` is pinned via `[patch.crates-io]` so ABI 7.40 + unrestricted ioctls are forwarded to FrankenFS handlers. This is the only mechanism by which FIEMAP / EXT4_IOC_* / BTRFS_IOC_* parity tests can exercise the real userspace handlers

- **Source-scope coverage gates** -- new gates ensure that fuzz orchestration (`bd-7pvw9`), fuzz targets (`bd-5u0sf`), and performance control (`7b32ee53`) are explicitly counted inside the source-scope coverage manifest so structural drift is caught at gate time

## Notes for Agents

- The historical `master` branch only exists for legacy URL compatibility; all work happens on `main` and the project tracker rejects `master`-referencing changes by convention.
- The single source of truth for tracked feature coverage is `FEATURE_PARITY.md`, parsed by `ParityReport::current()` in `ffs-harness`, and enforced by the `parity_report_matches_feature_parity_md` CI test.
- The single source of truth for release-gate behavior is `tests/release-gates/release_gate_policy_v1.json`.
- The evidence ledger event taxonomy is defined in `ffs-repair::evidence` and currently spans 30 `EvidenceEventType` variants. The five operator-facing CLI presets are `replay-anomalies`, `repair-failures`, `pressure-transitions`, and `contention` (plus the default tail view).
- Every machine-readable harness output is now snapshot-pinned with `insta`; if you change a report shape, run `cargo insta review` against `ffs-harness` before pushing.
- Cargo builds, tests, and clippy invocations should go through `rch exec -- cargo ...` when local resource contention from concurrent agent swarms could mask harness output. The hook is automatic for Claude Code; manual otherwise.
